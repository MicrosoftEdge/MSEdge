Hello Microsoft,

I am very excited for the new Edge browser, as it is built of chrome which I mainly use...
As Ive seen, we'll be able to import our bookmarks, passwords, and more from the old edge and other browsers such as Chrome...

Ive seen people say "the way it looks is bad", "it needs features from the old Edge to be brought back"..

So if you were to change to layout or add edges old features, please please please add the option to disable certain features in the browser, and be able to choose layouts such as:

Chrome
>Selected

Microsoft Edge
>Default

on and on.. What im trying to say is, let us choose between the way the browser will look, if you do accept what I've said, I do plan on switching from Chrome to the new Edge, but if it has features that I dont need or like, and it dosent look anything like Chrome and is slower, I might not switch..

Thank you for your time...
